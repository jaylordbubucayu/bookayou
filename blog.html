                We hear so much from students , my fellow schoolmates that they can't enjoy their day and night celebration. Which sounds interesting to pour out some attention
                , but we canâ€™t easily to say so.
                
                Having a Departamental Celebration is once in a year celebration in our school and seems like others look bored, but together or simply just a simple reminder we can trasform in to unforgetable moments in your life make it so fun and enjoyable,
                
                <br>
                 We can help each other through it. Instead of just ignoring the fact keep ourselves cheer up!
                <br><br>
                Hope this can help you a lot, Here are five ways
                 you can enjoy your Departamental Day Celebration.</p>
    <h2>1. Start the day with a prayer</h2>

    <img src="images/pray.gif" class="col-md-8">
    <p>  Start with a prayer gives to a  positive vibes, 
        Starting each day with a prayer, As God said in His word "In the morning, O Lord, 
        I will direct my song and my prayer unto You and will look up. (Psalm 5:3). 
<br><br>
As we start each day, we should seek His presence through prayer. For Him to be able
 to guide us, protect us, and give us what we need in that day. Prayer makes us see impossible 
 things possible.

 Means that your celebration will worth it and unforgetable.

        but it is for you.have a peacefull mindset that you will not do anything but to enjoy.

        <h2>3. Participate any contest</h2>
        <p>  join any contest before this is the chance to purchase your talents, and also to discover your hidden
            talent.
            <br> <br>
            as i joined the FOL(festival of lights),I will briefly share my expirence
            
            At first I wouldnt like to join this contest due to late night practice and also because  I knew it would affect my studies(just kidding)
             
            as I participate I meet lot of friends,see not only you can get a extra grades but also additional friends. We/I enjoyed the practice assuming 
            it was really our Time to perform.
            
            <br> <br>
            By the way here our video in our performance we are at the right side, hope you enjoy! </p>

              </video>
    
<p>Is it good? Even we stumble at the start we still finish it right. Like in the race it is not about how you
      start but rather how you finish the game</p>

        <h2>4. Watch your friends and with your friends</h2>
        <p>  
            Watching your friend participation/performance is giving your all out support so your friend will 
            gain confidence to do all his/her best.
            And Encourage Friends to do great in every step of the contest.
            <br> 
Dont forget to take some photos!

<p>Support is not just showing up because support really means is showing up when they didn't even need your help.
    Reminding you are always there at their side giving a hand without any favor or consequence.
    You want to be the one pushing your friends to be the best version of them they can be. 
    Don't push too hard as they have enough pressure on them as it is and do your job.
